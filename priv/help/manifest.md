# Declarative manifest (`aod apply`)

For more than a handful of agents/environments, manage them as YAML and reconcile via the CLI.

## Format

A `aod.yml` is a multi-document YAML file. Each doc is one resource with three top-level fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Environment | Vault | Agent
metadata:
  name: <unique-on-operator-side>
spec:
  # ... fields matching the API schema for the kind ...
```

The `metadata.name` is the upsert key. If a resource with that name exists, it's PUT; if not, it's POSTed.

## Order is irrelevant inside the file

`aod apply` reconciles **environments first, vaults second, agents last** — so an agent doc can reference an environment by name (`spec.environment: my-env`) even if that environment is defined later in the file. Vaults aren't referenced from agents (they're picked per-conversation), so the order between envs and vaults doesn't matter functionally; the predictable ordering just makes the apply output easier to skim.

## Example

```yaml
---
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: ravi-hq
spec:
  packages:
    apt: [jq, ripgrep]
  setup_script: cd /workspace && uv sync

---
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Vault
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  description: Alice's credentials
  secrets:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ghp_alice_...
    NPM_TOKEN: npm_alice_...

---
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: researcher
spec:
  runtime: claude
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  environment: ravi-hq        # ← resolved to environment_id at apply time
  system: You are a research assistant.
  skills: [aod]
  mcp_servers:
    everything:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]
```

## Apply

```bash
./aod apply -f aod.yml
```

Output uses `+` for create, `~` for update, one line per resource:

```
env    +  ravi-hq
vault  +  alice
  secret  ~  alice/GITHUB_TOKEN
  secret  ~  alice/NPM_TOKEN
agent  ~  researcher
```

Errors per-resource go to stderr but don't stop the run; other resources still apply.

## Idempotency

Re-applying the same file is a no-op (every resource shows `~` because we always PUT, but the spec doesn't change). Useful for CI: keep `aod.yml` in source control, run `aod apply -f aod.yml` from your deploy pipeline.

## Apply-time secret resolution (so you can commit `aod.yml`)

Secret values in `spec.secrets` accept two kinds of references that get resolved at **apply time** before any DB write:

- `${VAR}` — substituted from your local environment, or from `--var KEY=VAL` flags.
- `op://<vault>/<item>/<field>` — resolved via the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started). Auth (biometric unlock, session) handled by `op`.
- `bws://<secret-uuid>` — resolved via the [Bitwarden Secrets Manager CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-cli/). Auth via `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (consumed by `bws`).

Add another provider (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler, ...) by implementing `AodCli.SecretResolver` and registering the module — ~30 lines per provider.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: ravi-hq
spec:
  secrets:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GH_PAT}                              # ← from $GH_PAT at apply time
    POSTHOG_API_KEY: op://Work/PostHog/api_key           # ← resolved via 1Password CLI
    NPM_TOKEN: bws://be8e0ad8-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567   # ← Bitwarden Secrets Manager
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: op://${OP_VAULT}/Anthropic/key     # ← composes: ${VAR} then op
---
apiVersion: aod/v1
kind: Vault
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  secrets:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: op://Personal/GitHub/token
```

Run with:

```bash
GH_PAT=ghp_... POSTHOG=phc_... ALICE_GH_PAT=ghp_alice... \
  ./aod apply -f aod.yml

# or pass values inline:
./aod apply -f aod.yml --var GH_PAT=ghp_... --var POSTHOG=phc_...
```

Flags win over env vars when both are set. Use `$${VAR}` to write through a literal `${VAR}` (rare).

### Failure modes

Both kinds of resolution collect failures across the whole manifest and abort before any DB write — so you fix everything in one pass:

```
apply-time substitution failed — set these in the env or pass --var KEY=VAL:
  ravi-hq: GH_PAT, POSTHOG
  alice: ALICE_GH_PAT
```

```
apply-time secret resolution failed:
  ravi-hq:
    POSTHOG_API_KEY (op://Work/PostHog/api_key): [ERROR] ... session expired
    NPM_TOKEN (bws://abc-123): Error: invalid access token
```

If the relevant CLI isn't installed, you'll see install instructions for that provider. The two phases run in order — `${VAR}` first, then external refs — so values like `op://${OP_VAULT}/Anthropic/key` work.

### Scope

Apply-time resolution is **scoped to `spec.secrets`** only. Everything else in the manifest (agent system prompts, `mcp_servers` headers, etc.) is left literal — `${VAR}` references in those positions are resolved by the **provision-time** substitution layer when a conversation starts. Two layers, two scopes, one syntax.
