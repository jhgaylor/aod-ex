# Environments

An **Environment** describes the sprite shape to provision — what's installed, what's mounted, what the network looks like, and any setup script that runs before the runtime CLI.

Fields:

- **`packages`** — packages to install (currently `apt`)
- **`env_vars`** — env vars to inject into the sprite
- **`networking_type`** — `unrestricted` (default) or `limited`
- **`networking_config`** — for `limited`, an `allowed_hosts` list
- **`repositories`** — git repos to clone into the sprite at provision time, optionally authenticated via a secret
- **`setup_script`** — shell run after packages/clones, before the runtime CLI
- **`checkpoint_id`** — last successful provision's sprite checkpoint (managed by AoD; lets new conversations on the same env warm-start)

## Create one

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/environments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-project",
    "packages": {"apt": ["jq", "ripgrep"]},
    "env_vars": {"PROJECT_ROOT": "/workspace/my-repo"},
    "networking_type": "limited",
    "networking_config": {
      "allowed_hosts": ["github.com", "api.anthropic.com", "registry.npmjs.org"]
    },
    "repositories": [
      {
        "url": "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo",
        "mount_path": "/workspace/my-repo",
        "secret_key": "GITHUB_TOKEN"
      }
    ],
    "setup_script": "cd /workspace/my-repo && uv sync"
  }'
```

## Secrets

`repositories[].secret_key` references a **Secret** stored under the environment. Secrets are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest with the key from `SECRETS_KEY`. Add one:

```bash
ENV_ID=...
curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/environments/$ENV_ID/secrets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"GITHUB_TOKEN","value":"ghp_..."}'
```

Secrets are **never** returned by the API — only used internally during provisioning.

> Need to override these per-conversation (e.g. run as a different GitHub user)? See [Vaults](/help/vaults). A vault selected at conversation creation is layered over the environment's secrets, with vault values winning on key collision.

## SSH clones

Use `ssh_key_secret` instead of `secret_key`:

```json
{
  "url": "git@github.com:my-org/private-repo.git",
  "mount_path": "/workspace/private-repo",
  "ssh_key_secret": "DEPLOY_KEY"
}
```

The private key is written to a short-lived path inside the sprite, used as `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` for the clone, and removed on exit.

## Checkpoints

The first provision of a given environment captures a sprite checkpoint after setup completes. Subsequent conversations on the same environment warm-start from that checkpoint — packages already installed, repos already cloned, setup_script already run. Editing any of those fields invalidates the checkpoint, forcing the next provision to re-run from scratch and capture a new one.
