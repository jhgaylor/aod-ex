## Stream params

`GET /api/conversations/:id/stream` accepts:

- **`?streams=stdout,stderr,stage`** — comma-separated allow-list of event categories. Empty/missing = all. Unknown values = nothing.
- **`?wait=false`** — close immediately after replaying buffered events. Default keeps the stream open for live tailing (closes after ~60s of no activity).
- **`Last-Event-ID: <int>`** header — resume after this id; replay everything newer.

## Response envelope

All non-stream endpoints return:

```json
{ "data": { ... } }
```

or for lists:

```json
{ "data": [ { ... }, { ... } ] }
```

Errors come back with appropriate HTTP status and a body shaped like:

```json
{ "errors": [{"title": "...", "message": "...", "source": {"pointer": "/field"}}] }
```
