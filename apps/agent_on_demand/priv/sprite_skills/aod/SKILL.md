description: Spawn and stream Agent on Demand (AoD) conversations — for when this agent needs to fan out work to other coding agents. Use when the user asks you to "delegate to another agent", "spawn an agent", "fan out", or when a task is large enough to warrant parallel agents working in parallel sandboxes. AoD provisions an isolated Sprite, runs a configured agent in it, and streams output back over SSE. Reads `AOD_BASE_URL` and `AOD_TOKEN` from the environment.

# Agent on Demand (AoD) — From Inside a Sprite

You are running inside a Sprite that AoD provisioned. AoD itself is reachable
at `$AOD_BASE_URL` (the API lives under **`/api`**) with bearer `$AOD_TOKEN`.
From here you can spawn *more* AoD conversations — each one runs in its own
fresh Sprite.

> **Common mistake**: hitting `$AOD_BASE_URL/conversations` returns 302 (the
> bare path is the LiveView UI). The right URL is `$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations`.

## The two patterns you'll use

### A. Fan out N agents and collect their answers

```bash
# 1. Pick the agent (by name).
AGENT_ID=$(curl -s "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" \
  | jq -r '.data[] | select(.name == "echo-bot") | .id')

# 2. Spawn N conversations IN PARALLEL with xargs. Output is conv ids on stdout.
prompts=("First task" "Second task" "Third task")
ids=$(printf '%s\n' "${prompts[@]}" | xargs -n1 -P8 -I{} sh -c '
  curl -s -X POST "$1/api/conversations" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $2" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-AoD-Parent-Conversation-Id: $AOD_CONVERSATION_ID" \
    -d "$(jq -n --arg a "$3" --arg p "$4" "{agent_id:\$a, prompt:\$p}")" \
  | jq -r .data.id
' _ "$AOD_BASE_URL" "$AOD_TOKEN" "$AGENT_ID" {})

echo "$ids"   # one conv id per line

# 3. Wait for all of them in parallel.
echo "$ids" | xargs -n1 -P10 -I{} sh -c '
  while :; do
    s=$(curl -s "$1/api/conversations/$3" -H "Authorization: Bearer $2" | jq -r .data.status)
    case "$s" in running|pending) sleep 2 ;; *) break ;; esac
  done
' _ "$AOD_BASE_URL" "$AOD_TOKEN" {}

# 4. Gather the final text from each (claude runtime).
while IFS= read -r conv; do
  echo "=== $conv ==="
  curl -sN --max-time 5 \
    "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$conv/stream?streams=stdout&wait=false" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" \
  | awk '/^data: /{sub(/^data: /,""); print}' \
  | jq -r '.data | fromjson? | select(.type=="result") | .result' \
  | tail -n1
done <<<"$ids"
```

### B. Spawn one and block until it answers

```bash
AGENT_ID=...
PROMPT=...

CONV=$(curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AoD-Parent-Conversation-Id: $AOD_CONVERSATION_ID" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg a "$AGENT_ID" --arg p "$PROMPT" '{agent_id:$a, prompt:$p}')" \
  | jq -r .data.id)

while :; do
  s=$(curl -s "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$CONV" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" | jq -r .data.status)
  case "$s" in running|pending) sleep 2 ;; *) break ;; esac
done

curl -sN --max-time 5 \
  "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$CONV/stream?streams=stdout&wait=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" \
| awk '/^data: /{sub(/^data: /,""); print}' \
| jq -r '.data | fromjson? | select(.type=="result") | .result' \
| tail -n1
```

## SSE wire format (so you don't have to discover it)

A `curl -N` against `/api/conversations/:id/stream` produces lines like:

```
id: 2694
event: output
data: {"data":"{\"type\":\"result\",...}","stream":"stdout","stage":"turn",...}

id: 2695
event: output
data: {"data":"{\"type\":\"assistant\",...}","stream":"stdout",...}
```

Two layers of JSON. The `awk` strips the `data: ` prefix; jq's default parses
the **outer** object; **only the inner `.data` field is a JSON-encoded
string** that needs `fromjson` to peel. Do NOT call `fromjson` on the awk
output itself — jq already parsed it.

## The `wait=false` flag matters

The stream endpoint normally holds open for up to 60s waiting for new
events. **When the conversation is already done and you only want the
replay, pass `wait=false`.** Without it, your `curl --max-time 5` will sit
idle for the full 5 seconds. With it, the stream closes the moment the
replay drains — milliseconds.

Drop `wait=false` only when you actually want to live-tail.

## Per-runtime: where the final text lives

The conversation's `runtime` (`claude` / `codex` / `gemini` / `opencode`)
controls the shape of the inner JSON. Pull the runtime once, then pick the
right filter:

```bash
RT=$(curl -s "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$CONV" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" | jq -r .data.runtime)
```

| runtime  | filter (the part **after** `.data \| fromjson?`)                       | text path        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| claude   | `select(.type=="result")`                                              | `.result`        |
| codex    | `select(.type=="item.completed" and .item.type=="agent_message")`      | `.item.text`     |
| gemini   | `select(.type=="message" and .role=="assistant")`                      | `.content` *(use the last one)*  |
| opencode | `select(.type=="text")`                                                | `.part.text` *(concatenate all)* |

## Vaults — running as a different identity

If you need a spawned conversation to run with credentials other than what the
agent's environment provides (e.g. contribute to GitHub as a specific user), pass
an optional `vault_id` when creating it. List vaults to find the one you want:

```bash
curl -s "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/vaults" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" \
  | jq -r '.data[] | "\(.name)\t\(.id)"'

# Spawn with a specific vault layered on top of the env's secrets:
curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AoD-Parent-Conversation-Id: $AOD_CONVERSATION_ID" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg a "$AGENT_ID" --arg v "$VAULT_ID" --arg p "$PROMPT" \
        '{agent_id:$a, vault_id:$v, prompt:$p}')"
```

Vault values override the environment's baseline on key collision. Most fan-outs
don't need this — only reach for it when you specifically want different
credentials per spawned conversation.

## Multi-turn

Send a follow-up prompt to an existing conversation:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$CONV/prompts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Now compare that to the worker service."}'
```

Then poll status / read the stream the same way. The runtime session
resumes — the agent remembers turn 1.

## Tear down when you're done

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$AOD_BASE_URL/api/conversations/$CONV/terminate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOD_TOKEN"
```

## Important

- **Always `wait=false` for gather.** Otherwise you'll burn N × `--max-time` seconds for no reason.
- **Parallelize spawn / poll / gather** with `xargs -P` — one provisioning takes ~5–15s, and there's no reason to do them sequentially.
- **Don't recurse forever.** Spawned agents have the same skill. Cap depth with a `MAX_DEPTH` you check before spawning.
- **Costs add up.** Every conversation provisions a real sandbox.
- **Same `$AOD_TOKEN`.** All spawned agents share the single-tenant admin token. Don't leak it outside the sprite.
- **API path is `/api/...`.** The bare `/conversations` redirects (302 → /login) for non-browser requests.
- **Provenance is automatic.** `AOD_CONVERSATION_ID` is always present in your sprite's environment. Every `POST /api/conversations` call that includes `X-AoD-Parent-Conversation-Id: $AOD_CONVERSATION_ID` records this conversation as the parent, letting the operator reconstruct the full spawn chain.
